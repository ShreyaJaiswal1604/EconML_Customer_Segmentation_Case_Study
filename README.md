# EconML_Customer_Segmentation_Case_Study

## Overview

Welcome to the Dynamic Business Insights project! This repository explores the application of fundamental concepts such as causality, causation, and causal inference in the realm of statistical analysis, with a specific focus on a real-world case study: Customer Segmentation at an Online Media Company.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Causality, Causation, and Causal Inference

- **Causality:**
  - Understanding the relationship between cause and effect.
  - Fundamental for making predictions, guiding interventions, and optimizing strategies.

- **Causation:**
  - Direct influence of one variable on another.
  - Classic "counterfactual" definition.

- **Causal Inference:**
  - Pivotal in understanding cause-and-effect relationships.
  - Goes beyond correlation, drawing conclusions based on observational or experimental data.

### 2. Customer Segmentation

Explore the strategic marketing approach of dividing a broad target market into smaller, manageable customer groups:

- **Purpose:**
  - Create personalized and targeted marketing strategies.
  - Design approaches resonating better with specific customer groups.

- **Types of Segmentation:**
  - Demographic, Geographic, Psychographic, Behavioral.

- **Benefits:**
  - Improved Targeting.
  - Increased Customer Satisfaction.
  - Resource Optimization.

- **Examples:**
  - Online clothing retailer campaigns.
  - Food delivery service promotions.

- **Implementation:**
  - Utilizing data analysis tools, surveys, and machine learning for pattern identification.

### 3. Case Study: Customer Segmentation at an Online Media Company

Explore the application of causal inference techniques and data-driven strategies in a dynamic online media company scenario:

- **Objective:**
  - Estimate individualized responses for personalized pricing strategies.

- **Approach:**
  - *Causal Inference:* DoWhy library for constructing and validating causal models.
  - *Estimation:* EconML's DML-based estimators leveraging user features.
  - *Interpretation:* SingleTreeCateInterpreter for summaries on responsiveness to discounts.
